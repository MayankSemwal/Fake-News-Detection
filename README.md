# Fake-News-Detection
Using NLP and Machine Learning Algorithms to detect fake news
Malicious websites are of great concern to users and organisations nowadays because they rely
on web-pages, including online shopping, obtaining information etc. and it threatens the
privacy and security of users, organisation, governments as there is a problem in analysing
every website one by one and to index each URL in a blacklist. Even if we cannot observe a part
of malicious data, we can always observe compromised websites. Since vulnerable websites are
discovered by search engines, compromised websites have similar traits. Therefore, we built a
classifier by leveraging not only malicious websites but also compromised websites.
Unfortunately, there are lack of datasets which can identify the difference between malicious
and benign websites on the basis of their characteristics. To achieve this in our project, we have
gathered datasets from multiple resources and categorized them with attributes which define
the type of the website. In this project, we address the detection of malicious websites based
on their features gathered from multiple sources and use machine learning classification
techniques to test and train for future predictions.

Studied Supervised Learning and used models to classify benign and
malicious websites. The experimental results show that the Random Forest performed better
than other classification techniques used. RFC works best for unbalanced data because it does
not consist of skewness (E.g., Mean). Unequal instances for different classes. The overfitting
problem will never come when we use the random forest algorithm in any classification problem.
Logistic Regression can be used, if speed is the criteria, whereas in the case of categorical data
RF will perform better. However, Better use of misclassified data to update the weights and
classify them again to predict based on of more data, because more data leads to better
prediction. Finally, models appear to perform similarly across the datasets with performance
more influenced by choice of dataset rather than model selection.
